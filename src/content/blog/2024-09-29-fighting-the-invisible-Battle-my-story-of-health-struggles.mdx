Hey friends, if you are here, I wish you a healthy life and hope you are doing great physically and mentally. And please take care of your health. I learned it the hard way. Though I always preach about work-life balance, I ended up screwing up my health. 

I will share my journey, how I fought an invisible battle, and where I am currently.

# What happened 

In April 2024, my wife and I went for a full-body checkup, as we had hardly done it since we moved to Germany. We got our reports after a week, and my doctor gave me the bad news, I had symptoms of diabetes, and my blood sugar was 270 in the report. She was surprised at how I could do my day-to-day work as I should have mainly been sleeping; she was not wrong; thats was what I was doing, and my doctor mentioned she could write me a note to take some days off.

## Struggle with health

In the past three years, I have doubted myself thousands of times. If I were a good engineer, one thing that would have helped me succeed over the years would be my confidence that I could do anything. 

## I started to question myself: how did I end up here? 

It was all stress when Peter Parker stopped believing in himself in Spider-Man. I am not saying I am a superhero, but it was the same: everything was due to stress.

What happened 3 years ago, in Jan 2022, was I moved to Germany, and I was away from my family for 10 months, which caused me mental stress. With no support in a new country, it started impacting my health.

I have been under stress before; I struggled financially for almost my entire life and went through a phase where me and my wife were fighting every day to save our daughter and praying to god that she would come back home soon. 

But I always had my wife, daughter, and some amazing friends by my side, and we survived that phase. But not having my family and friends after moving to a new country was painful.

## Impact on work

After moving to Germany, I started underperforming at my first job, and I saw no future at the organization. I was lucky to join Celonis in Aug 2022, where my co-workers and employer gave me the support I wanted. 

For the first time in eight months, someone believed in me. I met some friends from the Indian community, which gave me some confidence back. My family joined me soon, but the damage was already done.

But I kept questioning myself if I was good enough.

## Questioning myself on every project

At Celonis, there were and still are many people who believed in me, but I want to be honest: I did not; I kept questioning myself on every project I worked on.

I used to feel bad when I received PR review comments or broke an app due to a coding mistake I made.

I was working on some initiatives, which were multi-quarter efforts, and I used to wonder why it was taking this long and why I was doing this. My managers and team believed I was the best person to do this and would finish this project. 


## Making my health worse

One thing I love more than anything is getting myself involved in the community; after joining Celonis, I started speaking at conferences worldwide and focusing less on my health. From October 2022 to October 2024, I was in more than 20 countries, sharing my knowledge on Angular, Nx, GitHub, and Open Source. 

And I could feel physically and mentally I was finding it hard; I was sleeping for more than 12 hours a day, still trying to force myself that I wanted to do this.

Forcing myself was a bad call; always listen to your body.

The above lines are so true. My body started forcing me to take that time, but I didn't like it.

Once I was diagnosed, I realized that going through mental and physical stress was the reason for diabetes.

# How am I doing now 

I started running, eating healthy, and stopped eating sugar after getting diagnosed. Now, I feel I am physically and mentally in the best shape of my life.

When I wanted to start running, I was wondering how am i supposed to take one hour from my schedule. But I realized you will alwasys have excuses, and Jan from The office said it best

> So want to do something whic is important, do it "there's always a million reasons not to do something."

At work, I am doing great. I was always scared to ask for feedback and a promotion, but now I feel ready for my promotion. I asked my colleagues for feedback and got some fantastic feedback, which made me think I was not a failure; I never was.


I posted my recent picture. I am so proud of my health now.

# Taking a break from Public Speaking

In life, nothing is free; everything comes at a cost. In the past three years, the cost of everything was compromising my health and family time.


<BlogImage src={speaking} alt="Myself on stage at InfoQ summit munich" />


After fixing my health, sleeping 8 hours a day is enough for me; I have 24+ hrs weekly and more energy. I started feeling like I could do more, but at what cost.

I asked my friends in the GitHub Stars Slack channel the same question: What would they do if they were in this situation?

The answer was 

**"Whenever you say "yes" to Something, you're saying "no" to Something else, Something more important to you and your family"**

I'm not going to lie; I felt terrible. I was doing Something that was not important to my family.

I also found myself in a situation where I was not enjoying conferences anymore. Although I gave my all and never compromised on the quality, I needed more time. 

The decision was not easy, but I took a step back to focus more on my health and family and do important things for my family.

What's the Plan?
* Get Permanent Residency in Germany.
* Get a driver's license. 
* Get the promotion at work.
* Enroll in swimming classes for my family next summer.
* Run a half marathon.

What about community, you say?

	I will continue to share my knowledge, but I will focus on other channels, such as writing, videos, and podcasts.

# Conclusion

Its hard to maintain balance between family, work and community. Take time for yourself, do exercise, for for a walk.

Always prioritize family and take enough rest when you are stressed out. 

Eating healty makes a big difference, and if possible go for body checkup every year. 

Pickup a hobby, running is my hobby now, I try to go for 5k walk multiple times and keep schedule to run longer over the weekend.
