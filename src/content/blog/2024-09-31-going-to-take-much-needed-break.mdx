Dear Friends,

I started public speaking five years ago, in September 2015, in Ng-Srilanka. I'm not going to lie; I love sharing my knowledge with everyone, and it gives me satisfaction, too.

Unfortunately, soon, in 2020, the entire world was under lockdown due to COVID-19, but I did not stop; I started speaking at online meetups and conferences.

After moving to Germany, my first in-person conference was in October 2022 in the US at Nx Conf, and wow, how crazy the last two years were! I hardly took a break in those two years and traveled to more than 20+ conferences in Europe, the US, and India.

I am happy to speak at React India in October 2022, next month in Goa, and meet the Indian community again one more time this year.

It was a hard decision. I love public speaking, and it helped me stay strong when I was struggling in my career and life. I also made some fantastic friends while traveling across the world. I will be active on YouTube doing live streams, writing blogs, and running our podcast.

>>> But I realized I could not do it anymore, and I needed a break. I will be away from public speaking till Oct 2025. 

I will miss traveling and seeing my friends next year, but I will be active in the community, contributing as GDE and GitHub Star, and planning to return to public speaking after Oct 2025.

With heartfelt thanks,

Santosh Yadav
