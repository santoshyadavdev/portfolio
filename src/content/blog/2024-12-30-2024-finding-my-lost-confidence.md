Hey friends, Happy New Year, and as we are saying goodbye to 2024, I wanted to share how my 2024 was.


2024 was a great year personally for me; even though I got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, everything worked out for good.

## Community

- I spoke at React India, Ng Belgrade, InfoQ Dev Summit Munich, and the What the Stack conference.
- I attended my second in-person GitHub universe, and my developer story was included in Keynote for day 2, one of the most significant achievements of my career in technology.
- Completed 4 years in the GitHub Stars program, 5 years as Angular GDE, and 2 years as Nx Champion.
- Became Microsoft MVP.
- We published 18 episodes of [This is Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThisisTechTalks) and grew our channel to 10.8k subscribers.
- Did some open source contribution [devswhorun.dev](https://devswhorun.dev/) and [Garmin API](https://github.com/santoshyadavdev/garmin-api)
- Started my [newsletter](https://santoshyadavdev.substack.com/) and got close to 40 subscribers, thanks for all the help.
- [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) joined me as my GitHub sponsor
- Shared over $2500 among open-source contributors this year as GitHub Sponsor.  
- I started writing again, I am still scared to write anything realated to Angular due to bullying back in 2022, but seems like I am recovering finally, I will start writing more next year.

## Health

- Did more than 280km in running since 16 June.
- I started Running, completed my first 10k, and could do it in under 1 hour, which was my goal.
- I reduced my weight from 74kg to 61kg and feel much better. My clothes size is down from medium to small, and my waist size is 28 inches from 32 inches before.
- Reduced my blood sugar its under 110 since I started running.
- Gave up processed sugar 8 month back, I eat more fruits specially berries and papaya.

## Family

- We finally went to india together after moving to Germany in 2022.
- Went for a road trip across Hanover, Berlin, and Bremen.
- This year was great financially for the family; we started saving money and purchasing things for the house, like a new refrigerator, which we wanted for a long time.
- Hiya made good progress in school; she is the first German speaker in our family.

## Professional

- I got the opportunity to lead a critical A11Y project, and we did a great job as a team.
- we shipped some great improvements to the monorepo and shared knowledge with the team.
- Convinced myself that I am ready for promotion and should not be scared to apply.


> My biggest win this year was getting my self-confidence back, thanks to my family and friends for all the help. 
> I wrote about [my health struggles](https://www.santoshyadav.dev/blog/2024-09-29-fighting-the-invisible-battle-my-story-of-health-struggles/) back in Oct if you are interested.


## What's coming in 2025

- 2025 will be more about family; we already have planned some vacations in Europe and possibly the US.
- Getting a driver's license is a top priority, and I am fully dedicated to it; I have already made some progress; wish me luck.
- Once I finish my driver's license, I need to start working towards my Permanent Residence, which requires some exams to clear.
- I have also applied for a promotion at work. The process should be completed by March 2025, and I am really looking forward to it; I deserve this promotion, but I am happy that my teammates think the same.
- We will keep bringing new episodes of This is Tech Talks, 2024 will be our season 4.
- I am planning to give some love to [my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TechTalksWithSantosh) in 2025 
- I will continue working on [devswhorun.dev](https://devswhorun.dev/) and [Garmin API](https://github.com/santoshyadavdev/garmin-api) I think these 2 projects have good potential in terms of my personal goal and helping the community.
- The renewal for GitHub Star is around; I wish to be in this program for another year; I love the people and the GitHub community.
- I promised to help more developers if they want to speak at conferences/meetups and need help reviewing the CFP. So, if you need help, I am a DM/email away.


I know a big list of things to do in 2025, but I am looking forward to another year and ready to give my best. And I am grateful to all my friends who always pray for me and my family; I wish you and your family an amazing 2025, and if you ever need help, remember I am just a DM away.
