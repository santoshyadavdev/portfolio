Hey Friends, how are you doing? I missed writing my newsletter this month because I am traveling for work across the EU and the US. But when I visited my office in Munich last week, I got big news from my manager on my promotion: "I GOT PROMOTED," and I am a "Staff Engineer."

It is only the second time in my 16-year career that I have heard these words; the last time I was promoted to the same job was in 2014 when I was promoted to Team Lead.

## Why I thought of getting the promotion
After joining Celonis in August 2022, my main focus was to survive this job; I was coming from a depression and a huge setback, and I thought of moving back to India.
But with the help of my teammates and managers, I got into my groove; I started giving my best at work and traveling across the world to spread my knowledge; I realized I am lucky to have a job where I get to follow my passion.

But things changed a little when I visited my Munich office in March 2023. While leaving the office to return home, I met my friend Ron, the QE team Lead. We had never met, so he called me and talked briefly. While introducing me to his colleague, he mentioned that I work as a Staff Engineer, which I was not. 

I wanted to know what a staff engineer is and thought I might be doing something that made Ron think I was a staff engineer. 

## Working on Promotion
I went back and spoke to my new manager regarding the promotion. Unfortunately, I was not with Celonis for even one year. My manager had joined a few months after me, so it didn't work out in 2023, and we discussed applying it in the next promotion cycle.

But I ended up having two more managers in the next year. Due to miscommunication, we never worked on my promotion until 2024; with my new manager ready to support me, I was prepared to apply.

## Journey to Promotion
I received not great news in 2024 when I got diagnosed with diabetes; I dropped the idea of applying for promotion and decided to focus on my health; I wrote my journey [here](https://www.santoshyadav.dev/blog/2024-09-29-fighting-the-invisible-battle-my-story-of-health-struggles/) 

After fixing my health, I decided to take on some critical projects for the Organization. During one of my conversations with my manager, I learned about the Accessibility project, and I asked my manager to give it to me. The team did amazing work, and we delivered the project to retain a big customer, saving a deal worth a million dollars.

After delivering the Accessibility project, I felt more confident that I could apply for promotion. I had another chat with my manager, and this time, I wanted to have a shot at promotion. 

My manager, Michael, and I worked together and applied for the promotion. Michael was very helpful with reviewing my documents, giving feedback, and personally working on the document.

## Why this promotion is Special
Before joining Celonis, I went through one of the worst phases in my personal and professional career; during my initial few months at Celonis, I was scared to write the code, and going through depression for close to 7 months did damage to my mental and physical health.

Getting this promotion proved that I am not a failure; I am a good engineer and dont need to prove this to anyone. This promotion gives me validation and boosts my confidence.

## Future plans
Now, I am even more motivated to deliver more at work and to the community, which is my passion. 
But before I start again, it is time to take some time off. I will be away in April month, traveling across Europe for the holidays with my family.

It was always a team effort at Celonis, which helped me to reach here, so I want to take this time to thank some of my teammates, who helped me become a better developer every day and helped me get this promotion:

- [Yazan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yazanaabed/)
- [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelrosett/)

I was lucky to have both of you as teammates, thank you so much for all the help and guidance in past 2.6 years at Celonis,

My managers, [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-guntsch/) and [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgeferrerzarzuela/), for believing in me.

And thanks to all my co-workers I interact with daily as part of my work.
