Last week, I was traveling to speak at CityJs + HalfStack Conf Belgrade, and suddenly, I thought about my past.

In the last year, I have traveled and presented my talk in many countries across Europe, the USA, the UK, and India. I realized how grateful I am that I can do this.

## I went back in time when 

- I walked 8kms to my college so that I could save 8 INR/ 0.096 USD
- Avoid taking shared auto while returning home from work so I could save some extra money for my daughter's treatment.
- Could not afford to buy a bed and mattress to sleep on.

## I also realized how lucky I am to spend so much time with my wife and daughter.

### There was a time. 
- I used to work more than 80 hours a week in a startup and used to be in the office for days.

## I am lucky that I can hug my daughter every day.
- I was so close to losing her. 
- I remember when she was born, I couldn't hold her in my arms, and I was scared for the next few months if I could ever do that.
- I remember holding her in my arms when she came back from the hospital, and I promised myself I would never leave her and hug her every day and hold her in my arms.

> I realized how lucky I am to live a life where I can fly to other countries without thinking about money. 

I was in tears for my entire flight between Vienna and Belgrade.

> The important lesson here is to remember where you came from and always be grateful for what you have.

For many, the life you are living is a dream.

## Thank you to everyone for being part of my journey.

- Thanks to my wife, who was always with me in my bad and good times.
- Thanks to my daughter, who loves me the most.
- Thank you to my friends who always support me.
- Thank you to the Angular and Tech community for showing love and support.

> Thanks to the GDE (Google Developer Expert) program for all the support (Travel and Stay) so I can present my talks at the conferences.

Thanks to my employer and friends at Celonis, I can manage my time traveling and caring for my family between work.
